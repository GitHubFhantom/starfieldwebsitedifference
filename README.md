Starfield is an upcoming Sci-Fi RPG video game from Bethesda Game Studios. They are the creators of the critically acclaimed games called Skyrim and Fallout 4. 
Starfield was announced on June 10, 2018, at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), and very little is known about it to this day. It is heavily rumoured that the game will be fully revealed in the summer of 2021, and multiple people with connections within the video game industry have hinted at it. There is also speculation that it will release the same year.
On May 8, 2021, a significant change was discovered on the Starfield website: within the source code of the site, there was an image related to the game that revealed much about such a secretive game. The image had been accidentally made public, when it was in fact meant to be private, and it was presumably meant for an upcoming background change on the website. Such things seemed to confirm that there is a reveal in the near future. 
After further digging, it was discovered that the site was last updated on April 29, 2021, and that this image had been undiscovered for serveral days. There are some claims, however, that the image actually was uploaded just a day before, in a seperate way. 
The purpose of this project is to discover any other hidden changes on the Starfield website. I will be copy-and-pasting the source code daily, and the computer will help me discover any changes.
If you've read this far, you need to get a life.
